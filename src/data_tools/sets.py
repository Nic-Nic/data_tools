def in_all(x, N):
    '''
    Checks if a vector x is present in all sets contained in a list N.

    * Arguments:
        - x [tuple]: Or any hashable type as long as is the same
          contained in the sets of N.
        - N [list]: Or any iterable type containing [set] objects.

    * Returns:
        - [bool]: True if x is found in all sets of N, False otherwise.

    * Examples:
        >>> N = [{(0, 0), (0, 1)}, # <- set A
        ...      {(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0)}] # <- set B

def bit_or(a, b):
    '''
    Returns the bit operation OR between two bit-strings a and b.
    NOTE: a and b must have the same size.

    * Arguments:
        - a [tuple]: Or any iterable type.
        - b [tuple]: Or any iterable type.

    * Returns:
        - [tuple]: OR operation between a and b element-wise.

    * Examples:
        >>> a, b = (0, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1)
        >>> bit_or(a, b)

    '''
    Returns the union set of all sets contained in a list N.

    * Arguments:
        - N [list]: Or any iterable type containing [set] objects.

    * Returns:
        - [set]: The union of all sets contained in N.

    * Examples:
        >>> A = {1, 3, 5}
        >>> B = {0, 1, 2}
        >>> C = {0, 2, 5}

    Finds and returns the subset of vectors whose sum is minimum from a
    given set A.

    * Arguments:
        - A [set]: Set of vectors ([tuple] or any iterable).

    * Returns:
        - [set]: Subset of vectors in A whose sum is minimum.

    * Examples:
        >>> A = {(0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1)}
        >>> find_min(A)
