# TODOs:

> IMPORTANT NOTE:

> Keep in mind the general scope of this project.

- Examples
- ~~Density plot docstrings~~
- ~~Update docstrings of Lasso~~
- ~~Fix Cs input (prints whole array in docs)~~
- ~~Formatting the reference~~
- ~~Add README to the reference docs?~~
- ~~README~~
- ~~LICENSE~~
- ~~Auto-docs~~

## Previous/current projects:

Check all code you made up to now and add all functions and classes that might
be useful in the context of this package/collection. Some places to find
interesting stuff which may be worth recycling.:

- ~~LASSO-MS~~
- ~~EMPA (newer implementation of LASSO-MS)~~
- FRETfit
- DIRECTOR
- CisPt-AKI
- MAGED2

## Other ideas:

- Something similar to Aurelien's magicPlot (but in Python 'cos it's better)
- Integrate PyPath finder? (too specific? keep independent?)
- Nice matplotlib plotters
- Data-processing functions (pandas-related mostly)
- What about a code-file parser to check coding style?
